# Ads-CTR-Optimisation
Optimise the Click Through Rate for 10 different advertisemens using two different reinforcement learning models: Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling. Coded in both Python and R <br/>
The goal is to find out which advertisement is most appealing by the most number of clicks, and compare the two different reinforcement learning models.  
In real life, we could get the dataset in R by data streaming, for instance using Spark or Hive, which means this is applicable in real time. In our case, we just wanted to evaluate the different models by simulating datasets.
